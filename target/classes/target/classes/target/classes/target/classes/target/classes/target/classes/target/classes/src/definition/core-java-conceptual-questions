Please answer the below core-java Questions:
What is programing language?
A.
A programing language is the language used  within computers.It is used to write computer
programs and also used to develop different applications.these programing languages are Python,Java,C++ ,etc.


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.1.JDK or as it is called Java Development Kit is a software that is used to develop and retrain apps. It is a full set that
contains the JRE (the Java RunTime Environment) and the JVM(Java Virtual Machine) and the compiler as well as the libraries.
A.2.JRE is another software which is used to run applications not to develop them, it contains the libraries and the JVM. Its purpose
is to provide the environment where a specific code or program can be executed.
A.3.JVM is a virtual machine which is operating system dependent . It is the one which executes our program and display the output.

What is IDE?
A.
Is integrated development environment (IDE),which is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. These
IDE's help programmers and testers to test ,run and debug applications.


What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.
Eclipse, IntelilJ IDEA, Eclipse Che, MyEclipse.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
The compiler converts the complete Java program to machine understandable format (from .java file-> .class file),which will be resulted in
 byte code (if there is no syntactical errors). Then by the means of JVM the byte code is translated and interpreted into machine code and display the output.

what is class?
A class is a blueprint or a logical entity where objects are created. Each and every class contains methods and variables that describe the state and
the behaviour of those objects.

What is object?  An object is a physical entity which is in java is a copy or an instance of the class.Without class objects can not be created. Each and
every object has state and behaviour .

What is the entry point of an application?
the main method is the entry point of an application.At the time of run time the JVM looks for the main method and the execution
starts from there.

Why main is static?
The main method in java is static to enable the JVM to access the method without creating an object of that class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
In Java the super class of all the classes is the Object class

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
path variable is used to set the path for all Java software tools like javac.exe, java.exe, javadoc.exe, and so on.
classpath variable is used to set the path for java classes

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
An Interface in java contains only abstract methods(no  bod) that are by default public and abstract.
An abstract Class contains both abstract and concrete methods . The latter can have any access modifier.In Interface no need
to declare the interface as abstract but in abstract class the keyword "abstract" is used in front oo the classname.Wth interface
we use the keyword"implements".In abstract class the "extend" keyword is used. The variables in interface are final and must
be initialized which is not the same in abstract class.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
No you can not create objects .But rather you can extend or implement and override the methods of the baseclass or the interface.

what is Access Specifier?
Access Specifier in java determine the visibility of the class members to other classes. And in Java there are four(4)
types (public,private,protected ,default)

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP?
Abstraction is implementaation hiding , in java it is achieved through interfaces and abstract classes.where we find only method
specification not method implementation.
Polymorphism is defined as a thing that has multiple forms.In java, polymorphism has two forms (method overloading and method
overriding).
Inheritance in java is achieved through parent child class where the child class or the derived clas inherits and acquire the properties
of the base class.
Encapsulation is binding the variables and the methods into a single entity to prevent their access from outside the class.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A package in java is used to group multiple classes and interfaces. It is like a folder used to save space managment and avoid naming
conflicts when two classes have the same name. the java.lang package is imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
API is Application Programming Interface  which acts as a mediator between two apps. In java there are different API's
for example java.lang , java.util ,java.io packages( that contain different classes, interfaces,methods and constructors0used
to write programs.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Java doesnt support multiple inheritance to avoid ambiguity and complexity. Because if both the parent class have the same
method name,it will be hard for the compiler to decide which method to inherit.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method overloading is having two or more methods in a class having the same name but different parameters. this type of methods
are called compile time polymorphism because at the compile time we know which method to be called.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Exeptions in java is the abnormal evets that prevent the fonctioning of a program.To handle these exceptions you need to provide
the try-catch block to specify where the exception might be and the type of the exception.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
"static" is a keyword in java and a non access modifier that is used for both variables and methods. Static or class variables is
independent from the object of a class and they are accessible through classname and they occupy a single memory.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
"final" in java means unchangeable
What is final, finally and finalize?
"final" is keyword and a non access modifier used with variables to prevent reassignment , methods to prevent to override them
and within a class to not extend it.
"finally" is a keyword in java that is used in Exception handling to ensure that a section of code is always executed, even if an exception
 is thrown.
 "finalize" is a method in Java used to perform cleanup processing on an object before it is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
Is a special kind of method but it has the same name as a class, no return type even the "void" and it is used to instantiate objects.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
yes we can, and this is called constructor overloading.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
It is called the default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
"this"keyword is used to differentiate the local variables from the class variables and also used with constructors
 overloading


What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
"super "is used in inheritance when both parent and chiled class have the same methods names and same variables names
it is used to differentiate the members of parent class from those of child class.

What is JVM stand for ?
A.Java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
A.It is  a virtual machine and operating system dependent.

What version of java are you using?
Version 8.

What is JAR stand for ?
Java ARchives used to group many files in one.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JDK is a full software that is used to develop run and execute programs.when JDK is dowloaded JRE and JVM are included.
As for JVM is used to execute programs and it virtual compared to JDK which is a physical (.exe file).

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
JVM is a virtual machine and a component in the JRE. It is the one which exectuting programs.The JRE is a software that
contains the libraries and the JVM. And it provides the environment where code will be executed.

What is compile time and run time?
In the compile time time the java program will be coverted into byte codes or class file,as for run time the JVM will execute
the bytecodes and display the output.

What is heap?
Is a memory allocated to new objects .Their reference will be stored in stack memory.

How java manage it's memory?
Java manages its memory by allocation and dealloctaion of objects in both heap and stack memories.
Primitive types and references of objects are created in the stack memory whereas the objects are created in the heap.whenever
the heap memory get full the unused objects will be cleared.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is  immutable class and a data type in java(reference type) which stores a sequence of characters or combined characters in double quotes"".
As for StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable classes their objects can be modified. But StringBuffer is thread safe and synchronized
whereas StringBuilder is not .

What is Singleton class?
Is a special class in java that has only and only one object reference or instance of the class. and doesnt permit to create other instances
because of its private constructor.To access it you check first if the reference object is null then you can create the object
otherwise you can not.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Means to convert the object state to a byte stream so that the byte stream can be reverted back into a copy of the object.
Deserialization is the reverse.

when to use transient variable in java?
Transient variables are variables that are initialized with their default values during de-serialization. Transient variables play an important
role in preventing objects from being serialized.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
While loop will check first the condition then it will execute the program. As for do..while loop, it will execute your
program at least once the checks the condition.

What is Enum?
Is a special class in java that contains constant variables that are not changeable. these variables are written in upper case.

What is Iterator?
An Iterator is used to iterate over each and evey element in a collection.The most used methods are next() and  hasnext().

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
An  int is a primitive data type and takes 32 bits(4 bytes) to store. On other hand Integer is an object
which takes 128 bits (16 bytes) to store its int value.So Integer takes more memory

Why is String Immutable in Java?
When creating objects they will occupy a certain memory  and whenever we modify them the modification is not donne on the same reference but rather
creates another reference.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
 The ability to call a constructor inside another constructor.This process can be done with the use of "this" keyword,instead
of creating multiple objects.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
Serial garbage collector uses a single thread for garbage collection process when it is implemented it freezes all
the application threads to run. While the parallel garbage collector uses multiple threads for the garbage collection.

What is JIT stands for?
Just In Time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Heap space is where objects reside.Whenever a new object is created a space is allocated to this object. When memory is full the garbage is collected.
the JVM will collect all the unused object to get space for new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
No, you can not.Since there is an "outOfMemoryException" raised when no there is lack of memory.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Stack is  a data structure used to store a definite size variables like int,double, float ,boolea etc. As for heap memory is used to
store objects of indefinite size like Strings in random order.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Reflection is an API that is able  to inspect and manipulate classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields at run time,
using different methods like getClass(),getMethod(),getConstructor().

what is multithreading in java?
It can be defined as the concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Is used to lock the current thread and the the remain threads will be in the wait position.
this process prevents confusion end ensures consistency.

What is Framework?
A Framework in java is pre-built libraries and modules that provide a set of common functionalities for building applications.
these libraries can be integrated into a given project and reuse its code .

What are the testing Framework available in java?
 JUnit, TestNG, and AssertJ.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
TestNG is a Java-based framework, while JUnit is an open-source Unit Testing Framework for JAVA.
 TestNG annotations are easier to use and understand than JUnit.
TestNG allows us to create parallel tests, whereas JUnit does not support running parallel tests.
In TestNG, Test cases can be grouped together, while in JUnit, Grouping tests together is not possible.

what is dependency injection in java?
It is the process of supplying a resource that a given piece of code requires.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
 Both static and dynamic binding are forms of polymorphism.static binding is achieved through method overloading and it is
 during the the compile time  that we know which method to be called.
In contrast, dynamic binding is achieved through method overriding during the run time.
